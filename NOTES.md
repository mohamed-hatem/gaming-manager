- Most data models could be changed to factory design pattern support to different types 
another alternative is figuring out generic approach for all of them.

- Sttributes to changed based on what we need for data analysis and historical data viewing.

- Database Managment could be changed to SQL or could even be a multmodel approach based on final attributes & relationships schema.

- Toying around with pandas, matplotlib, scikit. 

- Could be fun if we build an ML model to predict who might win a tournament based on past performances for player/team.


- Group players/teams per game_type based on skill level using clustering.

- Another ML model to suggest who could fit better with who / interesting rivalries (random teams tournament style).

- Players/Teams games pattern and recommendation for other games -> this could be a really interesting tool if we could 
get our hands on a games dataset and similarity feature -> could help us find new games that people might like.

- League (not LOL so Meral doesnt kill us all, ik jokes getting kind of old) played across a time period and the winner get bragging rights + a crown with a custom banner for the game

btw its so funny to see what i actually did in terms of work compared to this list :D 

joking aside there are several tracks to be completed for a fully functional system
Data Gathering, System Interface, Data Modeling, Data Analysis Module, Machine Learning Models, Hosting and deployment, Backend.
